The https://github.com/jcfriesen/vegmon.git contains the R code 'vegmon_img_proc.R' that is used to calculate the vegetation greeness index VIgreen as well as canopy cover from regular photos (RGB images).

Included, next to the .r file, are two sample images, one taken at a 45 degree angle and one taken at a 90 degree angle from above.

Based on the 45 degree angle image (p45.jpg), VIgreen can be estimated. Based on the 90 degree angle image (p90.jpg) both the VIgreen and canopy cover can be estimated.
